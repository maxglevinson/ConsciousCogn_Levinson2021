    <p>You have been invited to participate in this behavioral study. Please read this consent information
      attentively: it explains the procedure and your rights to information, confidentiality and of withdrawing from the
      study at any time.</p>

    <p><b>PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH STUDY</b></p>
    <p>This study seeks to better understand human sensory perception, including vision and hearing. For this research study, we will recruit
      approximately 500 participants, men and women, aged between 18-65.</p>

    <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH PROCEDURES</b></p>
    <p>This research study will take place on your home computer. Your participation will include one session lasting between 10-30 minutes.
      In this study you will participate in one or more simple computer-based perception tasks on your home computer's internet browser.
      Each task is expected to last no longer than 10 minutes. You will view pictures or hear recordings and answer questions about what you perceive.</p>

    <p><b>BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESEARCH STUDY</b></p>
    <p>There is no direct benefit to you in participating in this research besides monetary compensation. However, we hope that the study
      results will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.</p>

    <p><b>RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESEARCH STUDY</b></p>
    <p>We do not foresee any risks associated with this study.</p>

    <p> Your participation in this study is voluntary. Therefore, you may refuse to participate. You may also withdraw from the <i>ongoing</i>
      project at any time, without giving any reason, by closing your internet browser. Any useful data obtained prior to your withdrawal
      will be kept on record and used for research purposes and data analysis. This data will be anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.</p>

    <p><b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b></p>
    <p>Confidentiality of your personal information will be protected: the only persons who will be aware of your
      identity and demographic information will be the principal investigator and his co-investigators. Only anonymized
      data will be used for publication purposes, and this anonymized data might be made available in a data repository
      to other researchers for subsequent studies. Study data will be stored by the investigators for at least 10 years.</p>

    <p><b>FUNDING OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT</b></p>
    <p>The researcher and the institution have received funding from NSERC Discovery, Canada Research Chair, and Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives
      to conduct this research project.</p>

      your assigned task(s). If you withdraw before study completion, you will receive an amount proportional to your participation. However, if
      you fail to follow study instructions, your compensation may be withheld.</p>
