    <h2>Now, let’s quickly test how far away you are sitting.</h2>
    <p>You might know that vision tests at a doctor’s practice often involve chinrests; the doctor basically asks you to
        sit away from a screen in a specific distance.<br>We do this here with a “virtual chinrest”.
        <br>Please get comfortable and then try not to move your head for the rest of the experiment.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>1. Put your finger on <b>space bar</b> on the keyboard.</p>
    <p>2. Close your right eye. <em>(Tip: it might be easier to cover your right eye by hand!)</em></p>
    <p>3. Using your left eye, focus on the black square.</p>
    <p>4. Click the button below to start the animation of the red ball. The <b style="color: red">red ball</b> will
        disappear as it moves from right to left.<br>Press the “Space” key as soon as the ball disappears from your eye
        sight.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Please do it <b>six</b> times. Keep your right eye closed and hit the “Space” key fast when the ball disappears!
    </p>

    <div id="svgDiv" style="height:100px;"></div>
    Hit 'space' <div id="click" style='display:inline; color: red; font-weight: bold'>6</div> more times!
</div>
