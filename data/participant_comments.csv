1,"Sometimes there was what looked like a bevelled ring but mostly they just started to blend together and most of the time it looked like the centre disappeared into background, rather than background matching centre"
2,"blue circle"
3,""
4,"The centre was a lot darker and then the centre went the same brighter blue that the outside was."
5,"The centre circle would become the background colour over time"
6,"Usually, the centre colour slowly changed into the same colour as the outside."
7,"i had to stare at a dot in the center and keep my eyes there until the centre circle turned into the same colour as the outside."
8,"Its very few illusion i face"
9,"I was staring at it for a while and the centre circle was quite distinctive then all of a sudden it disappeared."
10,"It was usually the centre that changed colour, but sometimes the outside did as well. It also varied between being a gradual and immediate change in colour. It was often very hard to tell whether they were the same colour. A very fine distinction between the different shades of blue! "
11,"none"
12,"in most occasions it didn't change and I really wanted it to. I would look at the centre mark and the ring around the centre circle appeared on most occasions"
13,"There were lots of times when it almost disappeared but then an edge would change colour and keep the circle still visible. Towards the end I also seem to see the edge to the screen in different colours a lighter blue in my peripheral vision, like a glow. Overall though the  coulour change only seemed to happen maybe twice. I very often could see the edges swop colour or shade and as I say that kept the overall shape present"
14,"There were two distinct colours to start with then after about 5 seconds the middle colour faded away"
15,"The edges of the centre began to blur into one with the background"
16,"the colour slowly changed "
17,"it went from color to a gray fuzzy fast moving static"
18,"The centre would change colour to match the outside colour most of the time, then a ring outside the inner circle was appearing with the centre colour and outside colour spinning round the inner circle."
19,"The dark blues would usually emanate itself towards the outside color, whereas the lighter the color or similar to background the more likely it is to merge itself with each other. "
20,"i saw two blue circles and they sometimes merged into the same colour or did not change at all"
21,"The centre changed colour the most, usually slowly over time. "
22,""
23,"it was wobbly"
24,"The illusion occurred for me mostly in an inward from the outside pattern."
25,"Suddenly"
26,"It was more like bits of colour was changing in the centre and less like a perfect spread."
27,"The circle only disappeared completely a couple of times, although many times it nearly vanished and then became more clear again. In nearly all cases I saw shades of blue seeming to pulse around the edge of the circle."
28,"Not a lot happened, didnt enjoy it"
29,"It was fine and I had no technical problems with the illusion."
30,"Very little"
31,"It didn't on most occasions. Managed it during the trials, but virtually none of the live sessions worked."
32,"Not sure if I really understand the question -- it started off 'working' and then didn't really work anymore after a while?"
33,"It only occurred on the trials when the circle was bigger"
34,"It occurred during the test pages no problem but I seemed to not see it for most of the real instances, sorry"
35,"It didn't change most times. Sometimes I saw two circles, one empty, one  with the white dots."
36,"It looked like the colors were being manipulated almost simultaneously to arrive at the same color. However, only a few of these examples ever reached the same color."
37,"sometime it wouldn't change colors but other time the center would slowly fade in and out still it became the same color as the rest of the screen"
38,"Most often, the color change would sweep from one side to the other, alternating between the inner and outer colors changing. "
39,"alternation between the background outer section changing colour and the inner circle becoming the same colour as the outside "
40,"good"
41,"i could see static with a faint circle randomly changing position"
42,"it mostly consisted of the centre circle fading from one side to another, matching the outer colour."
43,"Inner circle darkened from the outside"
44,"The central circle would gradually fade into to colour of the background when I focussed on the centre dot."
45,"It didn't take long before they qiockly merged"
46,"The illusion throughout the study would change from no changes, to the outside or inside changing colors."
47,"blue screen with a slightly darker or brighter smaller blue circle in the center"
48,"It mostly disappeared after about 5 seconds and usually it was the centre disappearing from the middle"
49,"the outside slowly became the same color as the inner circle"
50,"It slowing starting spreading and then the circle just disappeared."
51,"the illusion seems to me as a full moon aligning with the sun"
52,"Faded in and out almost"
53,"I kept seeing the inner circle as darker than the outer colour. I was starting to worry that I was doing wrong!"
54,"dark blue circle and lighter blue background"
55,"At the start the illusion changed the center pretty quickly, ""engulfing"" the circle from the bottom to the top but then it started happening so fast I couldn't even tell"
56,"For the most part it involved the center portion blending into the color of the outer circle. I did notice that in my focus on the center cross, i couldn't accurately pick up happenings and subtle changes in the larger surroundings"
57,"The center circle became bigger"
58,"When continously staring at the white dot, everything becomes the same colour "
59,"a progressive change swept the image, usually originating from the center circle. In some trials i couldn't decipher a complete change till microseconds before the static screen came on."
60,"there was a darker circle inside a lighter screen and sometimes the darker circle would seem to creep out from the center and the outside would get darker. However, it rarely all became one color for me?"
61,"Typically it appeared as with the circle being dark with what appeared to be a raised rim. The darker centre colour would then normalise with the outer colour - typically from either an area just outside of the middle of the circle outwards, or alternatively from the left of the circle to the right. With the former the process felt more gradual, whilst with the later it was quicker - with the left of the circle changing colour first more slowly, before jolting the colour to the rest of the area. In almost all cases the ""rim"" was present before merging with the background briefly, then quickly returning. In the case of the colour moving from left to right the left part of the rim would always be present, with only the right part of the rim going through the merging / reappearing process. In all examples - where the colours merged that is - the contrast between the inner circle and outer colour returned quickly after my vision merged the colours. This occurred at times with no rim, and in others the contrast had one. "
62,"Mostly it didn't change but when it did the circle moved to the right then the colours changed"
63,"The centre appeared darker, sometimes fading a little but only disappeared twice"
64,"a lot of the time it change slightly but I could still see a difference in the colors"
65,"It ocurred ds22 black and white spot on a blue background."
66,"the border between the two colours start to move around then the colour change will come"
67,"It was always a big inner ring that changed to the colour of the outside"
68,"The center circle was usually darker, and usually gradually lightened over time to match the surrounding background color.  Most of the time it seemed to radiate out fro the center, other times it seemed to swips from one edge to another, or happen quickly all at once."
69,"Center color took on color from the outside, kind of blended in, though I would see a ring before the color blended completely."
70,"Most of the time the centre circle would gradually fade into the same colour as the surrounding background although sometimes one side of the centre circle would fade before the other side. I also noticed that a sort of border would form around the center circle and make it look like a 3D bump on the screen"
71,"It faded out mostly to where the center looked like the outside section"
72,"Sometimes senter changed colour, sometimes background "
73,"i rarely saw the colours merge together"
74,"All of a sudden the entire screen appeared the same color as the outside."
75,"I could only see the illusion a few times, when I was staring at the mark in the centre, the background colour would sometimes change."
76,"The Outside or Center changed color either gradually or faded from the outside in,  or the inside out. The whole screen then was the same colour "
77,"I had the gentle ridge around the edge which faded away as the colours merged. Very tough one to analyse in moment, felt like the outer colour was changing sometimes and not on others!"
78,"focusing on the target then the circle disappearing "
79,"It would take time usually, most often the center part looks the same colour as the outside, but the edge remains a darker colour for a while, and then gradually fades to same colour."
80,"The edge of the circle faded"
81,"The centre colour would change seemingly randomly to match the outside background. Sometimes instantaniously sometimes in a sort of pattern starting from the middle."
82,"The colours were contrasting blues and did not change in the last part of the test. "
83,"I could only see about 2 where the colours became one"
84," MOST OF THE TIME IT DIDN'T - THE COLOURS NEVER BECAME THE SAME EXCEPT ONCE OR TWICE WHERE THEY WERE THE SAME FROM THE BEGINNING"
85,"the circle mostly seemed to be the art that changed colour except towards the end where the outside seemed to change as well"
86,"Initially could see both colours and then after a while of focusing on the middle the whole screen was one colour "
87,"I stared at the center dot and either the circle disappeared or did not, sometime the outside of the circle became the same color as the circle and sometimes the opposite"
88,"it was fading in and out"
89,"It was always the center that changed colour"
90,"I saw a much darker circle than usual and then it seemed to change to the lighter outer blue instantaneously"
91,"Appeared to change after a few seconds mostly"
92,"In most of them, it would start slow and then fade in, but sometimes it would take a few seconds for my eyes to relax into it."
93,"There was a dot in the middle with a blue ring around it and then the backround was a different shade of blue"
94,"the last illusion didn't work. some of them worked, some of them didn't. the ones that did things always faded into eachother over a period of time. the ones that didn't work, a few of them were all the same colour form the start, another few just didn't change colour into eachother"
95,"Unclearly and quite slowly, sometimes seemed to go back a little bit as well"
96,"It was mostly the blues merging into the darker color from the inside out"
97,"it was very much instant but sometimes faded"
98,"there was a dark ball in the center, but it didn't really change color, maybe even changed to be darker, rather than lighter"
99,"The center slowly changed to thr"
100,"The center circle slowly blended into the background rectangle"
101,"The outside and the centre circle changed colour at different rates"
102,"Appeared as though the blue inner deeper colour would fade out and get wider nearly ever time "
103,"Gradually and slowly - if at all"
104,"Inconsistently. A few times there was a very obvious equalisation of colours but most of the time it either didn't happen at all or I was less sure. The change faded in rather than being instantaneous - except once I think. The problem I has was that while waiting for the fade to complete to equalisation I sometimes blinked and the circle fully reappeared."
105,"After a few seconds, the outside would appear to meld into the middle circle until the whole image would be one color."
106,"no  evvect observed except when dot and background started same colour"
107,"weird?"
108,"it looked like the blue circle was fading into the background color for the most part"
109,"i noticed some movement"
110,""
111,"a series of blue discs on a blue background with the disc colours changing colour to match that of the background"
112,"It always seemed to occur very gradually."
113,"It was a dark blue circle on a medium blue background. The inner circle seemed to wobble around its edge before fading into the background."
114,"Mostly I could see a darker circle around the dot and then lighter blue around the rest of the screen."
115,"The centre circle would change colour to the same colour as the outside after a few seconds. It often appeared to start on one side and then spread across to the other."
116,"The darker colored circle would expand, a bit fuzzy and undefined. It grows slowly until the whole screen looks the same color."
117,"The centre was generally darker, and then faded to the background colour. If my gaze moved fractionally, or I blinked, sometimes darker edeges to the centre appeared, and then ligher edges - a bit like an eclipse."
118,"The color changed mostly from the inside then faded gradually to the outside though it happened for like a split second"
119,"As I stared at the center, the inner and outer color became the same."
120,"The inside circle seemed to fade to the lighter color on the outside, but in almost all cases I could still see the dark rim of the circle "
121,"A change from right to left"
122,"Contrast between shape and background slowly faded until there was no edge between the two"
123,"sometimes it took longer than others and appeared to fade in different directions"
124,"sometimes it took longer to see it and I had to focus a lot on the centre"
125,""
126,"very difficult to describe, but mostly like the centre was fading into the background colour, either from the edge of teh circle or in an upwards sweeping movement"
127,"most of the time the center seemed to fade to the color of the outside"
128,"Slowly with the adjustment of my eyes. almost like a singular bubble on bubble wrap to begin with until the colours were the same and it appeared flat"
129,"Most of them seemed to have the same visual result except the last one"
130,"I could see multiple small circles of various sizes after the last illusion."
131,"a blue background with a large circle of a different colour fading to the same colour as the background"
132,"almost felt like the colors blurred together."
133,"On only a few occasions the centre colour apperared to change to the outer colour"
134,"A circle that would either go in our out, it changed colors as time progressed each trial."
135,"It spread out from the middle and left spots in my eyes. Weirdo stuff."
136,"Sometimes, it is hard to know how the colour spread"
137,"Most of the time it seemed to be changing in the center and from the inside out. It was a difficult task but I put forth my best effort."
138,"I am unsure of what is meant by this question. The illusion occurred when the center circle typically faded into the background"
139,"the color progressively changed"
140,""
141,"Small disc was darker than full screen.  Any movement of eyes would stop the effect, but in general the smaller disc faded into the same colour as the background after a few seconds."
142,"Mostly the center circle just blends to the background, starting from one side to the other"
143,"Most of the time i would see a circule wround the center and it would close in and change to the same color as the outside. There were a few, however, that were the same color right away. "
144,"Stared at the center and waited for the center circle to match the color of the outside"
145,"From the centre outwards and spread out"
146,"Blue circle on a blue square"
147,"slowly mostly"
148,""
149,"Slowly at first however as I started to look at it more the effect began to occur more and quicker; It like the colour suddenly flicks from one shade to another. "
150,"faded over time "
151,"After staring at the centre for a few seconds, the centre circle sort of merged and became the same colour as the outer area."
152,"When staring at the center, the color generally started to spread across the screen from the center, making the whole screen the same color. Sometimes it seemed like the color changed fast, other times it seemed to fade to the same color over time. There was generally a progression from the center color to spreading across the whole screen. "
153,"dark blue circle in the middle, lighter blue outside. the outside generally got darker"
154,"i never saw any changes.  there were a few times when the entire screen was the same color"
155,"the change of colour slid diagonally across until the whole colour was the same"
156,"the center circle more often than not seemed to gradually fade and become the same colour as the main part of the screen when staring at the centre"
157,"Gradually"
158,"The colours slowly faded together."
159,"It took a few seconds for the illusion to appear. The more I did it the easier it became to see the illusion. It also left a lingering image in my vision after the illusion had concluded."
160,"A circle "
161,"The last time, it faded from the right lower corner to the top left corner. It had never done that before. This illusion is freaky! I would love to read your paper on it. Can you email it to alightalike@gmail.com for me please?"
162,"The outside would gradually become the same as the inside.  "
163,"a blue background with a slightly different blue circle in the middle with a crosshair in the middle. Either the background would change to the same colour as the centre, the centre would change to be the same colour as the background, or near the end, both parts changed to become a colour in the middle."
164,"Most of the time it I saw the outside changing and matching the colour of the circle in the center."
165,""
166,"centre mostly spread into background"
167,"the colours were mostly fading outwards from the circle."
168,"The middle circle was a darker shade of blue which after a couple of seconds spread across the screen making the entire screen the darker blue, which initially was a lighter shade  "
169,"it was a blue background with white dot in the middle"
170,"It seemed to fade in a clockwise direction"
171,"I saw it in almost every way, but usually it was starting from one side and moving across, whether that be diagonally or straight. If I shifted my eyes one side would change colors then change back. "
172,"The center part started disappering "
173,"when i stared at the center cross i could see the colors blend together either starting from the center circle or outside of it. Sometimes i would notice it getting darker and other times lighter and i could see movement within the colors as well as they were fading in or out."
174,"By watching carefully at the dot, it gave me the illusion of the color spreading out most of the times."
175,"It mostly appeared that the inner circle was the one to change/fade in most trials. I suspect that was simply my retinas reacting to staring at the same point continuously and the whole thing was an optical trick. "
176,"It usually starts with a big blue circle that's darker in the center then fades into the background color starting from left to right or up to down. "
177,"The circle in the middle would blur, and it seemed like the ring was stretching outward or rotating until it blended so well I couldn't tell where the circle ended and outside it began."
178,"The color starting changing the more I stared at the center. Some changed very slowly and at a noticable pace. Some changed quickly."
179,"The inside circle was a thick blue and it the color flowed to flow causing the outside to match."
180,"A darkening of the space around the circle, sometimes fast, sometimes slow and once or twice instant."
181,"It worked well, the circle would merge with the background and blend in"
182,"The color began matching the background. I stared into the middle, and depending on how it changed,  the colors would blend and I couldn't see the edge of the circle. The border between the two would disappear."
183,"blue circle in the centre of screen on slightly different colour blue background that would slowly fade away"
184,"A dark blue circle on a lighter blue background which sometimes faded and sometimes remained constant"
185,"The ring was slowly disappearing from one side to the other until the entire screen was the same color."
186,"It happened in a few different ways, and was usually a gradual change where parts would fade together, and then it would wash over the rest."
187,""
188,"dark circle in the middle"
189,"i think there was a circle faking contrast that moved to my blind spot"
190,"The illusion started with the circle staying roughly the same colour for a few seconds, and then starting to slowly fade in with the background and circle merging to the same colour. This happened at varying speeds, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly. "
191,"The darker blue would slowly fade in"
192,"While staring at the center the circle in the middle would quite quickly start to fade into the surrounding color."
193,"It varied sometimes it appeared rapidly, but on most occasions it started to change and whilst i tried to retain focus on the centre it was as if the colours danced around the outside of the circle and my mind was questioning the change and forcing me to refocus."
194,"It started at the circle in the middle then it seemed it spread out from the center to be a solid color on my screen."
195,""
196,"The majority of the time moved across from one side to the other, the colour change was always around the centre rather than the outside. Once or twice there was no colour change."

198,"the center spread to the outside"
199,"There was dark blue circle in the center and every time the outside area fade into this color."
200,"It always gradually faded away starting from different parts of the circle"
